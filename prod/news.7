  new group status feature to limit the number of users allowed in a group.
  /status ? or /s_help will display the following info:
    /status      output now includes the current limit setting
    /status # N  will set the limit to N users (if you're moderator)
  the limits are only enforced in moderated or controlled groups (ie, not
  restricted groups).

  fixed the server's login code so that when the client passes a password
  for the nickname, it will properly attempt to authenticate you. most clients
  have a -p flag to take advantage of this (so you don't have to type your
  password in plain view of anyone looking at your screen)
