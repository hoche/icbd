    Rich Dellaripa turns off the icb.sjsu.edu server, perhaps to return
    by kzin.

    evolve.com server upgraded to darkside icbd server, a few minor bugs
    fixed here and there while porting (none interface related).

1/17/96:
    Fixed a bug which may or may not be related to idle-out problem.
    Added new /talk command which allows for more useful "moderated"
    group mode known as "controlled". See "/status ?" and /s_help for
    details.

    also added "www" field to registration database for storing WWW home
    page information.
