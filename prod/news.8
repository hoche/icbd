   upgraded server to v1.2b. some bug fixes and new server-side aways
   see /m server s_help for usage. client authors are encouraged to
   use server-side away features. users who are away now show up with
   a (aw) after their user@host account name. of particular note, having
   echoback set to "verbose" while away is set will timestamp when your
   away was triggered and by whom.

   also, as a test, MAX_IDLE has been unset for this server which means
   that no clients will be disconnected by being idle. idleboot is still
   defaulted to 60 minutes to shove people into group ~IDLE~ and can be
   overridden with /status b [minutes] or /status b 0 to disable

   to address the issue of groups that get held onto by super-idle
   moderators, a new feature "idlemod" is available. set this with
   /status im [minutes] (default 60, maximum 240 [4 hours]). current
   setting for your current group is included in /status output.
   if a mod is idle more than the idlemod value *and* there are other
   people in the group less idle than them, mod will be passed.

   upgraded server to v1.2a. no performance changes, just a some source
   tweaks.

mon may 8, '00:
   /whereis has been updated to be useful in tracking people who send you
   annoying messages. if run without any arguments, /whereis will now report
   info on the source of the last private message or group Probe attempt.

   also, the private hush list is now used to filter group Probe messages
   from hushed users.

   server upgraded to 128MB ram and a few days ago freebsd 3.1

mon feb 1, '99:
   fixed bug which allowed people to use /exclude to send open messages in
   quiet groups.

tue nov 3, '98:
   added optional parameter to /boot to personalize the message.
   usage: /boot nick Jackie Chan pops by and boots %s with a flying roundhouse.
   if you just do "/boot nick", it will default to "%s has been booted."

tue oct 20, '98:
   /ping is back, though i can't recall if it behaves the same as it used to.
   current use is to see how long it takes a client (which supports M_PING)
   to send a M_PONG message back to the server. if it never replies, you'll
   just not get a message back.

   a bug which was making /drop not work reliably has been fixed.

   oh yeah, max # users was upped to 1,000 and max groups was upped to 150
   (from 250/75) a while ago.

   the idleboot setting is now configurable on a per-group basis by the
   group's moderator with /status b.  default value is 1 hour, meaning 
   > 1hr idle people in the group will be booted to -IDLE-. 
   /status b 120    -> changes the idleboot to 2 hours
   /status b 0      -> disables idleboot for this group

   the message displayed when people are idle-booted is also configurable
   on a per-group basis by the moderator.  the default is:
       /status idlebootmsg A swarm of bats swoops down and carries %s away.
   the "%s" is replaced with the nickname of the user being booted for
   the public message to the group and with "you" for the private message
   to the booted user. other users can any non-default value with
   /status.

   fixes in /restart code were done which should remove the hanging-on-restart
   problem that is so damn annoying.

mon oct 19, '98:
   new idle behaviour implemented. if you're idle for 1 hr, you get
   autobooted to group -IDLE-. the disconnect idle-out is extended from
   90 minutes to 4 hrs
