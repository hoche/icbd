The ICB Server
--------------

ICB (Internet Citizen's Band) is a renaming of Sean Casey's original
ForumNet (or fn) program. Much of the code here-in is Sean's, though
considerable bug-fixing and extensions have been made over the
years such that it may be somewhat unrecognizable from the original.
John Atwood deVries and Rich Dellaripa performed some significant
changes from Sean's sources before I got a hold of it. In May of
2000, Michel Hoche-Mong performed some organizational clean-up,
tied in autoconf, and a few others. All of the changes from then
(approx 1995) up to current are noted in the file README.CHANGEHIST.

README.autoconf lists icbd developer information about autoconf
README.ToDo lists other desired changes to make.

This server and general ICB resources are maintained at the following
location:

Web  : http://www.icb.net/
FTP  : ftp://ftp.icb.net/pub/icb/
Human: "jon r. luini" <falcon@icb.net>
       "Michel Hoche-Mong" <hoche@grok.com>

Bugreports should be filed at: http://www.chime.com/bugzilla/

The common platforms this server has been run under are: FreeBSD,
Linux, SunOS 4.x, and Solaris.  Though it may compile and run fine
on other UNIX variants, it has not been tested.

Most all of the documentation in the source is horribly outdated, so
beware. See the file README.fn for Sean's original README file.
