# icbd - The ICB Server

ICB (Internet Citizen's Band) is a renaming of Sean Casey's original
ForumNet (or fn) program. Much of the code here-in is Sean's, though
considerable bug-fixing and extensions have been made over the
years such that it may be somewhat unrecognizable from the original.
John Atwood deVries and Rich Dellaripa performed some significant
changes from Sean's sources. Jon Luini then took over as the main
maintainer of it around 1995 and made numerous bugfixes over the next
several years. In May of 2000, Michel Hoche-Mong performed some
organizational clean-up, tied in autoconf, and made a few other
changes.

All of the changes from then (approx 1995) up to the time it was
imported into github (v1.2c) are noted in the file README.CHANGEHIST.

README.autoconf lists icbd developer information about autoconf
README.ToDo lists other desired changes to make.

General ICB resources are maintained at http://www.icb.net/
